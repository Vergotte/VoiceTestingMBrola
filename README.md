# VoiceTestingMBrola

This is a simple .mp3 file to test voices output from the MBROLA software. 

Six versions of the same text will be presented with various prononciations.

The goal is to try to identify which one is closest to a native english speaker.

Please send your answer (1 to 6) at gregoire.vergotte@liverpool.ac.uk

Thanks for your help and don't hesitate to share with friends, familly, etc.
